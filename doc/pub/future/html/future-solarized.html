<div class="alert alert-block alert-block alert-text-normal">
<b></b>
<p>
<b>Computations of almost all systems in science are central to our
basic understanding of nature and technological advances</b>.
</div>

<div class="alert alert-block alert-block alert-text-normal">
<b>Examples.</b>
<p>

<ul>
<li> <b>Nanotech and Materials</b>: quantum physical systems in nanotechnology; characteristics of new materials; semi-conductor devices and quantum computers</li> 
<li> <b>The smallest particles in nature</b>: subatomic physics at its smallest length scale</li>
<li> <b>And the largest</b>: simulating galaxies and the evolution of the universe</li>
<li> <b>Life science</b>: cancer treatment and how the brain works</li>

<b>Algorithm</b> : A finite set of unambiguous instructions that, given some set of initial conditions, can be performed in a prescribed sequence to achieve a certain goal.

<p>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-block alert-text-normal">

<p>
<b>Algorithmic  thinking as a way to</b> :

<ul>
<li> Enhance instruction based teaching</li>
<li> Introduce research-based teaching  from day one</li>
<li> Trigger further insights in math and other disciplines</li> 
<li> Validation and verification of scientific results, with the possibility to emphasize ethical aspects as well. Version control is central</li>
<li> Good working practices from day one</li>

<h2 id="___sec3">What do we mean with computing?  </h2>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-block alert-text-normal">
<b></b>
<p>

<p>
<b>Computing means solving scientific problems using computers. It covers numerical as well as symbolic computing. Computing is also about developing an understanding of the scientific process by enhancing algorithmic thinking when solving problems.</b>

<p>
And this  competence is about:

<ul>
<li> derivation, verification, and implementation of algorithms</li>
<li> understanding what can go wrong with algorithms</li>
<li> overview of important, known algorithms</li>
<li> understanding how algorithms are used to solve complicated problems</li>
<li> reproducible science and ethics</li>
<li> algorithmic thinking for gaining deeper insights about scientific problems</li>
</ul>

All these elements (and many more) aid students in maturing and gaining a better understanding of the scientific process <em>per se</em>.

<h2 id="___sec4">Computing and research-based education </h2>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-block alert-text-normal">
<b></b>
<p>
A computational approach allows us to introduce research concepts and engage students in research from <em>day one</em>.
</div>

<div class="alert alert-block alert-block alert-text-normal">
<b>How do we define research-based education?</b>
<p>
It is fully integrated with a direct participation in actual research and builds upon established
knowledge and insights about scientific methods.

<h2 id="___sec5">Research-based education </h2>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-block alert-text-normal">
<b>What should the education contain?</b>
<p>
The standard situation we meet at an almost daily basis:

<ul>
<li> Theory+experiment+simulation is almost the norm in research and industry</li>
<li> To be able to model complex systems with no simple answers. Solve real problems.</li>
<li> Emphasis on insight and understanding of fundamental principles and laws in the Sciences.</li>
<li> Be able to visualize, present, discuss, interpret and come with a critical analysis of the results, and develop a sound ethical attitude to own and other's work.</li>
<li> Enhance reasoning about the scientific method</li>
</ul>

Our education should reflect this. An example where this takes place is the <a href="http://www.mn.uio.no/fysikk/english/research/groups/computational/index.html" target="_blank">Computational Physics group at UiO</a>.  How can we implement in a systematic was a research-based education?

<div class="alert alert-block alert-block alert-text-normal">
<b></b>
<p>
A particular strength of physics students is their ability to pose and
solve problems that combine physical insights with mathematical
and  computational skills. This provides a unique combination
of applied and theoretical knowledge and skills. These features are invaluable 
for the development of multi-disciplinary educational and research programs for future challenges.

<div class="alert alert-block alert-block alert-text-normal">
<b></b>
<p>

<ul>
<li> <b>The main aim is that students should realize their own potentials and creative power</b></li>

<ul>
 <li> Students come with different dreams, ambitions, aspirations and topics they wish to study, our approach is to tailor the education to all these, an possibly more, aspects</li>
 <li> Our motto is to foster students which are better than their supervisors. This is how we define progress</li>
 <li> This creates an atmosphere for learning and sharing knowledge</li>
 <li> The emphasis is on learning and getting new insights. Students and teachers help each other</li>
 <li> No competing environment but a drive and enthusiam in sharing and developing new knowledge</li>
 <li> This creates an enviroment where students with different backgrounds and needs can thrive socially and scientifically</li>

<li> Project oriented work where students develop and mature their own ideas, with an individually tailored approach to each students</li>
<li> Office space with desktops to every student and large common room for recreational activities (meals, common lunches, gaming, watching movies etc etc)</li>

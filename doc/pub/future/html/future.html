The main topics of this talk are:

<ul>
<li> <b>Research-based education</b>, from undergraduate studies to a PhD: <a href="http://www.mn.uio.no/fysikk/english/research/groups/computational/index.html" target="_blank">The Computational Physics group at the University of Oslo</a> as example</li>

<div class="alert alert-block alert-block alert-text-normal">
<b></b>
<p>

<p>
<b>Computations of almost all systems in science are central to our
basic understanding of nature and technological advances</b>.

<p>
The increase in computational power,
improved algorithms for solving problems in science as well as access
to high-performance facilities, allow researchers nowadays to study
complicated systems across many length and energy scales. Applications
span from studying quantum physical systems in nanotechnology and the
characteristics of new materials or subamotic physics at its smallest
length scale, to simulating galaxies and the evolution of the universe.

<p>
Simulations are key to understanding
cancer treatment and how the brain works,
predicting climate changes and this week's weather,
simulating natural disasters, semi-conductor devices,
quantum computers, as well as assessing risk in the insurance and
financial industry.

<h2 id="___sec2">What do we mean with computing and computational science and physics?  </h2>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-block alert-text-normal">
<b></b>
<p>

<p>
<b>Computing means solving scientific problems using computers. It covers numerical as well as symbolic computing. Computing is also about developing an understanding of the scientific process by enhancing the algorithmic thinking when solving problems.</b>

<p>
And this  competence is about:

<ul>
<li> derivation, verification, and implementation of algorithms</li>
<li> understanding what can go wrong with algorithms</li>
<li> overview of important, known algorithms</li>
<li> understanding how algorithms are used to solve complicated problems</li>
<li> reproducible science and ethics</li>
<li> algorithmic thinking for gaining deeper insights about scientific problems</li>
</ul>

All these elements (and many more) aid students in maturing and gaining a better understanding of the scientific process.

Algorithmic  thinking as a way to

<ul>
<li> Enhance instruction based teaching</li>
<li> Introduce research-based teaching  from day one</li>
<li> Trigger further insights in math and other disciplines</li> 
<li> Validation and verification of scientific results, with the possibility to emphasize ethical aspects as well. Version control is central.</li>
<li> Good working practices from day one.</li>
</ul>

<b>Algorithm</b> : A finite set of unambiguous instructions that, given some set of initial conditions, can be performed in a prescribed sequence to achieve a certain goal.

<h2 id="___sec4">Computing and research-based education </h2>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-block alert-text-normal">

<p>
A computational approach allows us to introduce research concepts and engage students in research from <em>day one</em>.
</div>

<div class="alert alert-block alert-block alert-text-normal">
<b>How do we define it?</b>
<p>
It is coupled to a direct participation in actual research and builds upon established
knowledge and insights about scientific methods.

<h2 id="___sec5">Research-based education </h2>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-block alert-text-normal">
<b>What should the education contain?</b>
<p>
The standard situation we meet at an almost daily basis:

<ul>
<li> Theory+experiment+simulation is almost the norm in research and industry</li>
<li> To be able to model complex systems with no simple answers. Solve real problems.</li>
<li> Emphasis on insight and understanding of fundamental principles and laws in the Sciences.</li>
<li> Be able to visualize, present, discuss, interpret and come with a critical analysis of the results, and develop a sound ethical attitude to own and other's work.</li>
</ul>

Our education should reflect this. An example where this takes place is the <a href="http://www.mn.uio.no/fysikk/english/research/groups/computational/index.html" target="_blank">Computational Physics group at UiO</a>.  How can we implement in a systematic was a research-based education?

<div class="alert alert-block alert-block alert-text-normal">
<b></b>
<p>
A particular strength of physics students is their ability to pose and
solve problems that combine physical insights with mathematical tools
and now also computational skills. This provides a unique combination
of applied and theoretical knowledge and skills. These features are invaluable 
for the development of multi-disciplinary educational and research programs.

<ul>
<li> The main aim is that students should realize their own potentials and creative power</li>
<li> The computational physics group includes bachelor, master of science and doctoral students</li>
<li> Project oriented work where students develop and mature their own ideas, with an individually tailored approach to each students</li>
<li> Office space with desktops to every student and large common room for recreational activities (meals, common lunches, gaming, watching movies etc etc)</li>
<li> Many students collaborate on similar  thesis topics and <a href="http://www.dn.no/talent/2014/06/12/Utdannelse/sommervikar-ble-toppforsker" target="_blank">publish in top scientific articles</a></li>

<p>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-block alert-text-normal">
<b></b>
<p>
Present and future problems, unlike traditional
science and engineering, involve complex systems with many distinct
physical processes. The wide open research topic of this century, both
in industry and at universities, is how to effectively couple
processes across different length and energy scales. Progress will
rely on a multi-disciplinary approach and therefore the  need for
multi-disciplinary educational and research programs.
</div>


<p>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-block alert-text-normal">

We need to foster candidates with the right
multi-disciplinary background and computational thinking for

challenges.

<h2 id="___sec16">A new type of students </h2>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-block alert-text-normal">
<b></b>
<p>
Candidates who are capable of modeling and understanding complicated
systems, are in short supply in society.  The
computational methods and approaches to scientific problems students learn
when working on their thesis projects are very similar to the methods
they will use in later stages of their careers.  To handle large
numerical projects demands structured thinking and good analytical
skills and a thorough understanding of the problems to be solved. This
knowledge makes the students unique on the labor market, a labor market which in the years to come will experience heavy automatization and massive loss of jobs.

<p>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-block alert-text-normal">
<b>How to achieve it.</b>
<p>

<ul>
<li> Establish  a new center/department with focus on computational science and its applications to a wide range of fields (natural science, medicine, social sciences, humanities, applied research etc)</li>
<li> Hire ten (or more) young professors (age \( < 40 \)) dedicated to innovative research and education where computations play a central role</li>
<li> Establish another ten professorships (or more) with  shared positions (position percentage  is flexible) between the  new department and the department of appartanence (physics, chemistry, etc etc).</li>

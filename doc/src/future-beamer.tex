\frametitle{What does computing mean?}

\begin{block}{}

\textbf{Computing means solving scientific problems using computers. It covers numerical as well as symbolic computing. Computing is also about developing an understanding of the scientific process by enhancing the algorithmic thinking when solving problems.}
\end{block}

\begin{block}{Computing competence is about: }

\begin{itemize}
\item derivation, verification, and implementation of algorithms

\item understanding what can go wrong with algorithms

\item overview of important, known algorithms

\item understanding how algorithms are used to solve complicated problems

\item reproducible science and ethics

\item algorithmic thinking for gaining deeper insights about scientific problems
\end{itemize}

\noindent
All these elements (and many more) aid students in maturing and gaining a better understanding of the scientific process \emph{per se}.
\end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[plain,fragile]
\frametitle{Computing and research-based education}

\begin{block}{}
A computational approach allows us to introduce research concepts and engage students in research from \emph{day one}.
\end{block}


\begin{block}{What should the education contain? }

\begin{itemize}
\item Theory + experiment + simulation is the norm in research and industry

\item Modeling of real, complex systems with no simple answers

\item Insight and understanding of fundamental principles and laws

\item Visualization, presentation, discussion, interpretation, and critical analysis of results

\item Development of a sound ethical attitude to own and other's work

\item Enhanced reasoning about the scientific method

\item Individually tailored education in order to let students  realize their full potentials and discover their creative powers
\end{itemize}

\noindent
This is what we do in the \href{{http://www.mn.uio.no/fysikk/english/research/groups/computational/index.html}}{Computational Physics group at UiO}!

\frametitle{A social and scientific learning environment}

\begin{block}{}
\textbf{Goal: Students should realize their full potentials and discover their creative powers}

\begin{itemize}
 \item Students come with different dreams, ambitions, aspirations and topics they wish to study, our approach is to tailor the education to all these aspects

 \item Our motto: foster students who are better than their supervisors

 \item Emphasis is on learning and getting new insights

 \item Students and teachers help each other

 \item Students with different backgrounds and needs can thrive socially and scientifically

 \item Not a competitive environment, but a drive and enthusiam for sharing and developing knowledge. This is an important element for the  success of for example multi-disciplinary projects 
\end{itemize}

\noindent
\end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[plain,fragile]
\frametitle{We develop a social and scientific learning environment}

\begin{block}{}
\begin{itemize}
\item We target bachelor, MSc and PhD students

\item Project-oriented work where students develop and mature their own ideas, with an individually tailored approach to each student

\item Office space with desktops to every student and large common room for recreational activities (meals, gaming, movies)

\item Many students collaborate on similar  thesis topics and \href{{http://www.dn.no/talent/2014/06/12/Utdannelse/sommervikar-ble-toppforsker}}{publish in top scientific journals}
\end{itemize}

\begin{columns}
\column{0.2\textwidth}
\begin{block}{Our supercomuting cluster }
When UiO's previous supercomputing cluster (titan.uio.no) was replaced by \textbf{abel.uio.no}, we got 200 nodes for free from USIT and built our own supercomputer. The value in 2006 of all the equipment was close to eight MNOK.
\begin{itemize}
\item It helps students run and develop programs for large-scale problems locally

\item A successful program can then run on larger national and international supercomputers

\item Students run and maintain the local supercomputer

\item Used in regular courses as well
\end{itemize}

\begin{block}{}
\begin{itemize}
\item Present and future problems, unlike traditional
  science and engineering, involve complex systems with many distinct
  physical processes

\item The wide open research topic of this century, both in industry and at universities, is how to effectively couple processes across different length and energy scales

\item Progress will rely on a \emph{multi-disciplinary} approach
\end{itemize}

\noindent
\end{block}

\begin{block}{}
We need to foster candidates with the right
multi-disciplinary background and computational thinking!
\end{block}

\begin{frame}[plain,fragile]
\frametitle{The future: A new type of students}

\begin{block}{}
\textbf{Computations will play a central role in almost all aspects of scientific investigations and technological innovation}
\end{block}

\begin{block}{}
\textbf{Candidates who are capable of modeling and understanding complicated systems, are in short supply in society}.
\end{block}
\begin{block}{}
We need students that
\begin{itemize}
\item can handle large and demanding multi-disciplinary  projects. This requires structured thinking and good analytical skills and a thorough understanding of the problems to be solved
\end{itemize}

\noindent
This knowledge makes the students unique on the labor market, a labor market which in the years to come will experience heavy automatization and massive loss of jobs.
\end{block}
\begin{block}{}
This will lay the foundation for cross-disciplinary
educational, research and innovation activities.
% It will contribute to building a common cross-disciplinary
% approach to key strategic initiatives, with important examples from fields like
% \emph{Energy research, Materials science and  Life Science}.

\frametitle{Create the Department for Computational Science!}

\begin{block}{}
UiO's strength in computational science (education and research)
has the potential to make UiO a top European university
\end{block}

\begin{block}{How to achieve it }
\begin{itemize}
\item Establish  a new center/department with focus on computational science and its applications to a wide range of fields (natural science, medicine, social sciences, humanities, applied research etc)

\item Hire ten young professors (age $< 40$) dedicated to innovative \emph{computational} research and education

\item Establish another ten professorships with  shared positions between the  new department and the discipline-specificdepartment (physics, chemistry, ...)

\item Establish  best practices for computational and educational innovations, with a particular focus on  new learning material 
\end{itemize}

\noindent
\end{block}

\textbf{The process must start now} in order not to lose momentum.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[plain,fragile]
\frametitle{Our takeaway messages}

\begin{block}{}
\begin{itemize}
\item Computing plays and will play an even more important role in future scientific and technological advances

\item A successful research program cannot be disconnected from education and vice versa

\item An educational and research program which focuses on these issues needs to be established as soon as possible

\item Key goal: students must realize their own potentials and creative power

===== Modeling and computations as a way to enhance algorithminc thinking =====

!bblock
_Algorithm_ :
A set of instructions to solve a problem.
!eblock

!bblock Algorithmic thinking applies to all disciplines. It
* Enhances instruction-based teaching
* Introduces research-based teaching  from day one
* Triggers further insights in scientific problems
* Emphasizes validation and verification of scientific results, and integrates science ethics in a natural way
* Ensures good working practices from day one!

===== What does computing mean?  =====

!bblock

_Computing means solving scientific problems using computers. It covers numerical as well as symbolic computing. Computing is also about developing an understanding of the scientific process by enhancing the algorithmic thinking when solving problems._
!eblock

!bblock Computing competence is about:

* derivation, verification, and implementation of algorithms
* understanding what can go wrong with algorithms
* overview of important, known algorithms
* understanding how algorithms are used to solve complicated problems
* reproducible science and ethics
* algorithmic thinking for gaining deeper insights about scientific problems

All these elements (and many more) aid students in maturing and gaining a better understanding of the scientific process *per se*.

!split
===== Computing and research-based education =====

!bblock
A computational approach allows us to introduce research concepts and engage students in research from *day one*.
!eblock


!bblock What should the education contain?

* Theory + experiment + simulation is the norm in research and industry
* Modeling of real, complex systems with no simple answers
* Insight and understanding of fundamental principles and laws
* Visualization, presentation, discussion, interpretation, and critical analysis of results
* Development of a sound ethical attitude to own and other's work
* Enhanced reasoning about the scientific method
* Individually tailored education in order to let students  realize their full potentials and discover their creative powers

This is what we do in the "Computational Physics group at UiO":"http://www.mn.uio.no/fysikk/english/research/groups/computational/index.html"!

===== "Computational Physics group at UiO":"http://www.mn.uio.no/fysikk/english/research/groups/computational/index.html"; our visions =====

!bslidecell 00 0.4
!bblock
Physics students can _pose and solve problems_ that combine _physical insights_ with _mathematical tools_ and now also _computational skills_. This provides a unique combination of applied and theoretical knowledge and skills. These features are invaluable for the development of multi-disciplinary educational and research programs.

===== A social and scientific learning environment =====

!bblock
_Goal: Students should realize their full potentials and discover their creative powers_

 * Students come with different dreams, ambitions, aspirations and topics they wish to study, our approach is to tailor the education to all these aspects
 * Our motto: foster students who are better than their supervisors
 * Emphasis is on learning and getting new insights
 * Students and teachers help each other
 * Students with different backgrounds and needs can thrive socially and scientifically
 * Not a competitive environment, but a drive and enthusiam for sharing and developing knowledge. This is an important element for the  success of for example multi-disciplinary projects 
!eblock



!split
===== We develop a social and scientific learning environment =====

!bblock
* We target bachelor, MSc and PhD students
* Project-oriented work where students develop and mature their own ideas, with an individually tailored approach to each student
* Office space with desktops to every student and large common room for recreational activities (meals, gaming, movies)
* Many students collaborate on similar  thesis topics and "publish in top scientific journals":"http://www.dn.no/talent/2014/06/12/Utdannelse/sommervikar-ble-toppforsker"

===== Features of the Computational Physics group =====
!bblock
* Our students have made significant contributions to  the "Computing in Science Education":"http://www.mn.uio.no/english/about/collaboration/cse/"  (UiO education prize in 2011) by developing exercises and participating in educational projects at the MN faculty
* Our students have also developed educational "tools and applications for understanding complicated physical problems":"http://www.mn.uio.no/fysikk/om/aktuelt/aktuelle-saker/2015/realfagsapper.html"
* A group of PhD students is now developing "new textbooks for Computational Life Science":"https://github.com/CINPLA/ibvcse"
* 2005-2015: $> 60$ students have finalized their master's theses and 60% have continued with PhD studies
* Many students don't want to leave the group after finishing their studies

!bslidecell 00 0.2
!bblock Our supercomuting cluster
When UiO's previous supercomputing cluster (titan.uio.no) was replaced by _abel.uio.no_, we got 200 nodes for free from USIT and built our own supercomputer. The value in 2006 of all the equipment was close to eight MNOK.
* It helps students run and develop programs for large-scale problems locally
* Students run and maintain the local supercomputer
* Used in regular courses as well

===== Multiscale modeling is the big open research question in the 21st century =====

!bblock
* Present and future problems, unlike traditional
  science and engineering, involve complex systems with many distinct
  physical processes
* The wide open research topic of this century, both in industry and at universities, is how to effectively couple processes across different length and energy scales
* Progress will rely on a *multi-disciplinary* approach
!eblock

===== The future: A new type of students =====

!bblock
_Computations will play a central role in almost all aspects of scientific investigations and technological innovation_
!eblock

!bblock
_Candidates who are capable of modeling and understanding complicated systems, are in short supply in society_.
!eblock
!bblock
We need students that
* can handle large and demanding multi-disciplinary  projects. This requires structured thinking and good analytical skills and a thorough understanding of the problems to be solved

This knowledge makes the students unique on the labor market, a labor market which in the years to come will experience heavy automatization and massive loss of jobs.
!eblock
!bblock
This will lay the foundation for cross-disciplinary
educational, research and innovation activities.
#It will contribute to building a common cross-disciplinary
#approach to key strategic initiatives, with important examples from fields like
#*Energy research, Materials science and  Life Science*.

_Candidates who are capable of modeling and understanding complicated
systems, are in short supply in society_.
!eblock
!bblock
The computational methods and approaches to scientific problems students learn
when working on their thesis projects are very similar to the methods
they will use in later stages of their careers.
* To handle large numerical projects demands structured thinking and good analytical skills and a thorough understanding of the problems to be solved.
* This knowledge makes the students unique on the labor market, a labor market which in the years to come will experience heavy automatization and massive loss of jobs.

===== Create the Department for Computational Science! =====

!bblock
UiO's strength in computational science (education and research)
has the potential to make UiO a top European university
!eblock

!bblock   How to achieve it
* Establish  a new center/department with focus on computational science and its applications to a wide range of fields (natural science, medicine, social sciences, humanities, applied research etc)
* Hire ten young professors (age $< 40$) dedicated to innovative *computational* research and education
* Establish another ten professorships with  shared positions between the  new department and the discipline-specificdepartment (physics, chemistry, ...)
!eblock

_The process must start now_ in order not to lose momentum.



!split
===== Our takeaway messages =====
!bblock
* Computing plays and will play an even more important role in future scientific and technological advances
* A successful research program cannot be disconnected from education and vice versa
* An educational and research program which focuses on these issues needs to be established as soon as possible
* Key goal: students must realize their own potentials and creative power

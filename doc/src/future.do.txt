!bblock

* _Research-based education_, from undergraduate studies to a PhD: "The Computational Physics group at the University of Oslo":"http://www.mn.uio.no/fysikk/english/research/groups/computational/index.html" as example
* Future challenges and directions
!eblock
!bblock Takeaway message
A successful research program cannot be disconnected from education and vice versa

!split
===== The role of computations, from education to society =====
!bpop
!bblock
_Computations of almost all systems in science are central to our
basic understanding of nature and technological advances_.
!eblock

!bblock Examples
* _Nanotech and Materials_: quantum physical systems in nanotechnology; characteristics of new materials; semi-conductor devices and quantum computers
* _The smallest particles in nature_: subatomic physics at its smallest length scale
* _And the largest_: simulating galaxies and the evolution of the universe
* _Life science_: cancer treatment and how the brain works
* _Geosciences_: predicting climate changes and this week's weather, simulating natural disasters
* _Finance_: assessing risk in the insurance and financial industry
* and many many more

_Algorithmic  thinking as a way to_ :
* Enhance instruction based teaching
* Introduce research-based teaching  from day one
* Trigger further insights in math and other disciplines 
* Validation and verification of scientific results, with the possibility to emphasize ethical aspects as well. Version control is central
* Good working practices from day one

===== Computing and research-based education =====

!bpop
!bblock
A computational approach allows us to introduce research concepts and engage students in research from *day one*.
!eblock
!bblock How do we define research-based education?
It is fully integrated with a direct participation in actual research and builds upon established
knowledge and insights about scientific methods.

[hpl: Think this is unclear...better to just phrase it orally?]

===== Research-based education =====

!bblock What should the education contain?

* Theory + experiment + simulation is the norm in research and industry
* Modeling of real, complex systems with no simple answers
* Insight and understanding of fundamental principles and laws
* Visualization, presentation, discussion, interpretation, and critical analysis of results
* Development of a sound ethical attitude to own and other's work
* Enhanced reasoning about the scientific method

This is what we do in the "Computational Physics group at UiO":"http://www.mn.uio.no/fysikk/english/research/groups/computational/index.html"!

A particular strength of physics students is their ability to _pose and
solve problems_ that combine _physical insights_ with _mathematical tools_
and now also _computational skills_. This provides a unique combination
of applied and theoretical knowledge and skills. These features are invaluable
for the development of multi-disciplinary educational and research programs.

 * Our motto: foster students who are better than their supervisors - that's progress!
 * Students and teachers help each other
 * Students with different backgrounds and needs can thrive socially and scientifically
 * No competing environment, but a drive and enthusiam for sharing and developing knowledge

===== Multiscale modeling is the big open research question in the 21st century =====

!bblock
* Present and future problems, unlike traditional
  science and engineering, involve complex systems with many distinct
  physical processes
* The wide open research topic of this century, both in industry and at universities, is how to effectively couple processes across different length and energy scales
* Progress will rely on a *multi-disciplinary* approach

multi-disciplinary background and computational thinking!

===== The future: A new type of students =====

!bblock
_Computations (mastering and developing)  will play a central role in almost all aspects of scientific investigations and technological innovation_
!eblock

!bblock
_Candidates who are capable of modeling and understanding complicated
systems, are in short supply in society_.
!eblock
!bblock
We need students that
* can handle large and demanding multi-disciplinary  projects. This requires structured thinking and good analytical skills and a thorough understanding of the problems to be solved

This knowledge makes the students unique on the labor market, a labor market which in the years to come will experience heavy automatization and massive loss of jobs.

===== The challenges for the future =====
!bblock
We need to educate the next generation of
science students with the knowledge, skills, and values needed to pose
and solve current and new scientific, technological and societal
challenges.

This will lay the foundation for cross-disciplinary
educational, research and innovation activities. It will contribute to building a common cross-disciplinary

!eblock
!bblock
The computational methods and approaches to scientific problems students learn
when working on their thesis projects are very similar to the methods
they will use in later stages of their careers.
* To handle large numerical projects demands structured thinking and good analytical skills and a thorough understanding of the problems to be solved.
* This knowledge makes the students unique on the labor market, a labor market which in the years to come will experience heavy automatization and massive loss of jobs.

===== Create the Department for Computational Science! =====

!bblock
UiO's strength in computational science (education and research)
has the potential to make UiO a top European university
!eblock

!bblock   How to achieve it
* Establish  a new center/department with focus on computational science and its applications to a wide range of fields (natural science, medicine, social sciences, humanities, applied research etc)
* Hire ten young professors (age $< 40$) dedicated to innovative *computational* research and education
* Establish another ten professorships with  shared positions between the  new department and the discipline-specificdepartment (physics, chemistry, ...)
!eblock

_The process must start now_ in order not to lose momentum.

* Computing plays and will play an even more important role in future scientific and technological advances
* A successful research program cannot be disconnected from education and vice versa
* An educational and research program which focuses on these issues needs to be established as soon as possible
* Key goal: students must realize their own potentials and creative power

===== The role of computations, from education to society =====
!bblock
_Computations of almost all systems in science are central to our
basic understanding of nature and technological advances_.
!eblock
!bblock Examples
* quantum physical systems in nanotechnology and the characteristics of new materials
* subamotic physics at its smallest length scale
* simulating galaxies and the evolution of the universe
* cancer treatment and how the brain works
* predicting climate changes and this week's weather
* simulating natural disasters
* semi-conductor devices, quantum computers,
* assessing risk in the insurance and financial industry
* and many many more

===== Modeling and computations as a way to enhance algorithminc thinking =====
!bblock 
_Algorithm_ : A finite set of unambiguous instructions that, given some set of initial conditions, can be performed in a prescribed sequence to achieve a certain goal.
!eblock

!bblock Algorithmic  thinking as a way to

* Enhance instruction based teaching
* Introduce research-based teaching  from day one
* Trigger further insights in math and other disciplines 
* Validation and verification of scientific results, with the possibility to emphasize ethical aspects as well. Version control is central.
* Good working practices from day one.

===== What do we mean with computing and computational science and physics?  =====
!bblock

_Computing means solving scientific problems using computers. It covers numerical as well as symbolic computing. Computing is also about developing an understanding of the scientific process by enhancing the algorithmic thinking when solving problems._

And this  competence is about:

* derivation, verification, and implementation of algorithms
* understanding what can go wrong with algorithms
* overview of important, known algorithms
* understanding how algorithms are used to solve complicated problems
* reproducible science and ethics
* algorithmic thinking for gaining deeper insights about scientific problems

All these elements (and many more) aid students in maturing and gaining a better understanding of the scientific process.

===== Computing and research-based education =====
!bblock 
A computational approach allows us to introduce research concepts and engage students in research from *day one*.
!eblock
!bblock How do we define it?
It is coupled to a direct participation in actual research and builds upon established
knowledge and insights about scientific methods.
!eblock



!split
===== Research-based education =====
!bblock What should the education contain?
The standard situation we meet at an almost daily basis:

* Theory+experiment+simulation is almost the norm in research and industry
* To be able to model complex systems with no simple answers. Solve real problems.
* Emphasis on insight and understanding of fundamental principles and laws in the Sciences.
* Be able to visualize, present, discuss, interpret and come with a critical analysis of the results, and develop a sound ethical attitude to own and other's work.
* Enhance reasoning about the scientific method
 
Our education should reflect this. An example where this takes place is the "Computational Physics group at UiO":"http://www.mn.uio.no/fysikk/english/research/groups/computational/index.html".  How can we implement in a systematic was a research-based education?

===== "Computational Physics group at UiO":"http://www.mn.uio.no/fysikk/english/research/groups/computational/index.html"; implementing our visions =====
!bblock
A particular strength of physics students is their ability to pose and
solve problems that combine physical insights with mathematical tools
and now also computational skills. This provides a unique combination
of applied and theoretical knowledge and skills. These features are invaluable 
for the development of multi-disciplinary educational and research programs. 
!eblock


!split
===== Develop a social, scientific and learning environment =====
!bblock
* The main aim is that students should realize their own potentials and creative power
 * Students come with different dreams, ambitions, aspirations and topics they wish to study, our approach is to tailor the education to all these aspects
 * Our motto is to foster students which are better than their supervisors. This is how we define progress
 * This creates an atmosphere for learning and sharing knowledge
 * The emphasis is on learning and getting new insights. Students and teachers help each other
 * This creates an enviroment where students with different backgrounds and needs can thrive socially and scientifically
 * No competing environment but a drive and enthusiam in sharing and developing new knowledge
!eblock



!split
===== Develop a social, scientific and learning environment =====
!bblock
* The computational physics group includes bachelor, master of science and doctoral students
* Project oriented work where students develop and mature their own ideas, with an individually tailored approach to each students
* Office space with desktops to every student and large common room for recreational activities (meals, common lunches, gaming, watching movies etc etc)
* Many students collaborate on similar  thesis topics and "publish in top scientific articles":"http://www.dn.no/talent/2014/06/12/Utdannelse/sommervikar-ble-toppforsker"
!eblock



!split
===== Developing a good learning environment =====
!bblock
* Our students have made significant contributions to  the "Computing in Science Education":"http://www.mn.uio.no/english/about/collaboration/cse/"  (UiO education prize in 2011) by developing exercises and participating in educational projects at the MN faculty
* Our students have also developed educational "tools and applications for understanding complicated physical problems":"http://www.mn.uio.no/fysikk/om/aktuelt/aktuelle-saker/2015/realfagsapper.html" 
* The students keep shaping and developing the scientific, social and pedagogical activities of the group
* A group of PhD students is now developing "new textbooks for Computational Life Science":"https://github.com/CINPLA/ibvcse"
* During the last ten years more than 60 students have finalized their master theses in computational physics and  almost 60% have continued with PhD studies
* Many students don't want to leave the group after finishing their studies

===== The future: Multiscale modeling is the big open research question =====

!bblock
Present and future problems, unlike traditional
science and engineering, involve complex systems with many distinct
physical processes. 
* The wide open research topic of this century, both in industry and at universities, is how to effectively couple processes across different length and energy scales. 
* Progress will rely on a multi-disciplinary approach and therefore the  need for multi-disciplinary educational and research programs.

!bblock
We need to foster candidates with the right
multi-disciplinary background and computational thinking for
understanding present and future simulation technologies and their challenges.

===== The challenges for the future =====
!bblock
We need to educate the next generation of 
science students with the knowledge, skills, and values needed to pose
and solve current and new scientific, technological and societal
challenges. 
!eblock
!bblock
This will lay the foundation for cross-disciplinary
educational, research and innovation activities. It will contribute to building a common cross-disciplinary
approach to key strategic initiatives, with examples like *Energy, Materials, Life Science, and Enabling Technologies*. 
!eblock





!split
===== A new type of students =====
!bblock
_Candidates who are capable of modeling and understanding complicated
systems, are in short supply in society_.  
!eblock
!bblock
The computational methods and approaches to scientific problems students learn
when working on their thesis projects are very similar to the methods
they will use in later stages of their careers.  
* To handle large numerical projects demands structured thinking and good analytical skills and a thorough understanding of the problems to be solved. 
* This knowledge makes the students unique on the labor market, a labor market which in the years to come will experience heavy automatization and massive loss of jobs.
!eblock

!bblock
Computations (mastering and developing)  will play a central role in almost all aspects of scientific investigations and technological innovation
!eblock



!split
===== What we should do: create the Department  for Computational Science =====
!bblock What we have and where we can arrive
* UiO's strength in computational science (education and research) will play an important role in  determining new research and educational directions
* Exploiting this strength has the potential to make UiO a center of excellence for scientific innovation
!eblock

!bblock   How to achieve it
* Establish  a new center/department with focus on computational science and its applications to a wide range of fields (natural science, medicine, social sciences, humanities, applied research etc)
* Hire ten (or more) young professors (age $< 40$) dedicated to innovative research and education where computations play a central role
* Establish another ten professorships (or more) with  shared positions (position percentage  is flexible) between the  new department and the department of appartanence (physics, chemistry, etc etc).
!eblock

_The process must start now_ in order not to loose momentum.

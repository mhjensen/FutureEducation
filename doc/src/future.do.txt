===== This talk is about how we perceive the role of education; present and future =====
!bblock

* _Research-based education_, from undergraduate studies to a PhD: "The Computational Physics group at the University of Oslo":"http://www.mn.uio.no/fysikk/english/research/groups/computational/index.html" as example
* Future challenges and directions

!eblock

===== The role of computations, from education to society =====
!bpop
!bblock
_Computations of almost all systems in science are central to our
basic understanding of nature and technological advances_.
!eblock

!bblock Examples
* quantum physical systems in nanotechnology and the characteristics of new materials
* subamotic physics at its smallest length scale
* simulating galaxies and the evolution of the universe
* cancer treatment and how the brain works
* predicting climate changes and this week's weather
* simulating natural disasters
* semi-conductor devices, quantum computers,
* assessing risk in the insurance and financial industry
* and many many more

===== Modeling and computations as a way to enhance algorithminc thinking =====

!bpop
!bblock
_Algorithm_ :
A set of instructions to solve a problem.
#A finite set of unambiguous instructions that, given some set of initial condit#ions, can be performed in a prescribed sequence to achieve a certain goal.
!eblock

!bblock Algorithmic thinking:

* Enhances instruction-based teaching
* Introduces research-based teaching  from day one
* Triggers further insights in math and other disciplines
* Emphasizes validation and verification of scientific results, and integrates ethics
* Ensures good working practices from day one!

===== What does computing mean?  =====

!bblock

_Computing means solving scientific problems using computers. It covers numerical as well as symbolic computing. Computing is also about developing an understanding of the scientific process by enhancing the algorithmic thinking when solving problems._
!eblock


!bblock Computing competence is about:

* derivation, verification, and implementation of algorithms
* understanding what can go wrong with algorithms
* overview of important, known algorithms
* understanding how algorithms are used to solve complicated problems
* reproducible science and ethics
* algorithmic thinking for gaining deeper insights about scientific problems

All these elements (and many more) aid students in maturing and gaining a better understanding of the scientific process.

===== Computing and research-based education =====

!bpop
!bblock
A computational approach allows us to introduce research concepts and engage students in research from *day one*.
!eblock
!bblock How do we define it?
It is coupled to a direct participation in actual research and builds upon established
knowledge and insights about scientific methods.

[hpl: Think this is unclear...better to just phrase it orally?]

!split
===== Research-based education =====

!bblock What should the education contain?

* Theory + experiment + simulation is the norm in research and industry
* Modeling of real, complex systems with no simple answers
* Insight and understanding of fundamental principles and laws
* Visualization, presentation, discussion, interpretation, and critical analysis of results
* Development of a sound ethical attitude to own and other's work
* Enhanced reasoning about the scientific method

This is what we do in the "Computational Physics group at UiO":"http://www.mn.uio.no/fysikk/english/research/groups/computational/index.html"!

!bslidecell 00 0.6
!bblock
A particular strength of physics students is their ability to _pose and
solve problems_ that combine _physical insights_ with _mathematical tools_
and now also _computational skills_. This provides a unique combination
of applied and theoretical knowledge and skills. These features are invaluable
for the development of multi-disciplinary educational and research programs.

===== We develop a social and scientific learning environment =====

!bblock
The main aim is that students should realize their own potentials and creative power

 * Students come with different dreams, ambitions, aspirations and topics they wish to study, our approach is to tailor the education to all these aspects
 * Our motto: foster students who are better than their supervisors - that's progress!
 * Students and teachers help each other
 * Students with different backgrounds and needs can thrive socially and scientifically
 * No competing environment, but a drive and enthusiam for sharing and developing knowledge
!eblock



!split
===== We develop a social and scientific learning environment =====

!bblock
* We target bachelor, MSc and PhD students
* Project-oriented work where students develop and mature their own ideas, with an individually tailored approach to each student
* Office space with desktops to every student and large common room for recreational activities (meals, gaming, movies)
* Many students collaborate on similar  thesis topics and "publish in top scientific journals":"http://www.dn.no/talent/2014/06/12/Utdannelse/sommervikar-ble-toppforsker"
!eblock



!split
===== Features of the Computational Physics group =====
!bblock
* Our students have made significant contributions to  the "Computing in Science Education":"http://www.mn.uio.no/english/about/collaboration/cse/"  (UiO education prize in 2011) by developing exercises and participating in educational projects at the MN faculty
* Our students have also developed educational "tools and applications for understanding complicated physical problems":"http://www.mn.uio.no/fysikk/om/aktuelt/aktuelle-saker/2015/realfagsapper.html"
* A group of PhD students is now developing "new textbooks for Computational Life Science":"https://github.com/CINPLA/ibvcse"
* 2005-2015: $> 60$ students have finalized their master's theses and 60% have continued with PhD studies
* Many students don't want to leave the group after finishing their studies

===== Multiscale modeling is the big open research question in the 21st century =====

!bblock
* Present and future problems, unlike traditional
  science and engineering, involve complex systems with many distinct
  physical processes
* The wide open research topic of this century, both in industry and at universities, is how to effectively couple processes across different length and energy scales
* Progress will rely on a *multi-disciplinary* approach
!eblock

!bblock
We need to foster candidates with the right
multi-disciplinary background and computational thinking!

===== The challenges for the future =====
!bblock
We need to educate the next generation of
science students with the knowledge, skills, and values needed to pose
and solve current and new scientific, technological and societal
challenges.
!eblock
!bblock
This will lay the foundation for cross-disciplinary
educational, research and innovation activities. It will contribute to building a common cross-disciplinary
approach to key strategic initiatives, with examples like *Energy, Materials, Life Science, and Enabling Technologies*.
!eblock

[hpl: Repetitions on this slide, lengthy text - better to just phrase this in the delivery]




!split
===== A new type of students =====
!bblock
_Candidates who are capable of modeling and understanding complicated
systems, are in short supply in society_.
!eblock
!bblock
The computational methods and approaches to scientific problems students learn
when working on their thesis projects are very similar to the methods
they will use in later stages of their careers.
* To handle large numerical projects demands structured thinking and good analytical skills and a thorough understanding of the problems to be solved.
* This knowledge makes the students unique on the labor market, a labor market which in the years to come will experience heavy automatization and massive loss of jobs.
!eblock

!bblock
Computations (mastering and developing)  will play a central role in almost all aspects of scientific investigations and technological innovation
!eblock

[hpl: True, but at this point time is needed for the new institute... Suggest to remove this slide.]

!split
===== Create the Department for Computational Science! =====

!bblock
UiO's strength in computational science (education and research)
has the potential to make UiO a top European university
!eblock

!bblock   How to achieve it
* Establish  a new center/department with focus on computational science and its applications to a wide range of fields (natural science, medicine, social sciences, humanities, applied research etc)
* Hire ten young professors (age $< 40$) dedicated to innovative *computational* research and education
* Establish another ten professorships with  shared positions between the  new department and the discipline-specificdepartment (physics, chemistry, ...)
!eblock

_The process must start now_ in order not to lose momentum.



!split
===== Our success builds on the Computing in Science Education project (UiO educational prize in 2011)  =====

!bblock
The results, insights, ideas and thoughts presented here, would have been impossible without the continuous interaction with colleagues in the "Computing in Science Education":"http://www.mn.uio.no/english/about/collaboration/cse/" project.

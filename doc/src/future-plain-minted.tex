\subsection*{What does computing mean?}


% --- begin paragraph admon ---
\paragraph{}

\textbf{Computing means solving scientific problems using computers. It covers numerical as well as symbolic computing. Computing is also about developing an understanding of the scientific process by enhancing the algorithmic thinking when solving problems.}
% --- end paragraph admon ---




% --- begin paragraph admon ---
\paragraph{Computing competence is about:}

\begin{itemize}
\item derivation, verification, and implementation of algorithms

\item understanding what can go wrong with algorithms

\item overview of important, known algorithms

\item understanding how algorithms are used to solve complicated problems

\item reproducible science and ethics

\item algorithmic thinking for gaining deeper insights about scientific problems
\end{itemize}

\noindent
All these elements (and many more) aid students in maturing and gaining a better understanding of the scientific process \emph{per se}.
% --- end paragraph admon ---

\subsection*{Computing and research-based education}


% --- begin paragraph admon ---
\paragraph{}
A computational approach allows us to introduce research concepts and engage students in research from \emph{day one}.
% --- end paragraph admon ---





% --- begin paragraph admon ---
\paragraph{What should the education contain?}

\begin{itemize}
\item Theory + experiment + simulation is the norm in research and industry

\item Modeling of real, complex systems with no simple answers

\item Insight and understanding of fundamental principles and laws

\item Visualization, presentation, discussion, interpretation, and critical analysis of results

\item Development of a sound ethical attitude to own and other's work

\item Enhanced reasoning about the scientific method

\item Individually tailored education in order to let students  realize their full potentials and discover their creative powers
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{}
Physics students can \textbf{pose and solve problems} that combine \textbf{physical insights} with \textbf{mathematical tools} and now also \textbf{computational skills}.
Essential for multi-disciplinary programs.
% This provides a unique combination of applied and theoretical knowledge and skills. These features are invaluable for the development of multi-disciplinary educational and research programs.

\subsection*{A social and scientific learning environment}


% --- begin paragraph admon ---
\paragraph{}
\textbf{Goal: Students should realize their full potentials and discover their creative powers}

\begin{itemize}
 \item Students come with different dreams, ambitions, aspirations and topics they wish to study, our approach is to tailor the education to all these aspects

 \item Our motto: foster students who are better than their supervisors

 \item Emphasis is on learning and getting new insights

 \item Students and teachers help each other

 \item Students with different backgrounds and needs can thrive socially and scientifically

 \item Non-competitive and generous environment
% Not a competitive environment, but a drive and enthusiam for sharing and developing knowledge. This is an important element for the  success of for example multi-disciplinary projects
\end{itemize}

\noindent
% --- end paragraph admon ---





% !split
\subsection*{We develop a social and scientific learning environment}


% --- begin paragraph admon ---
\paragraph{}
\begin{itemize}
\item We target bachelor, MSc and PhD students

\item Project-oriented work where students develop and mature their own ideas, with an individually tailored approach to each student

\item Office space with desktops to every student and large common room for recreational activities (meals, gaming, movies)

\item Many students collaborate on similar  thesis topics and \href{{http://www.dn.no/talent/2014/06/12/Utdannelse/sommervikar-ble-toppforsker}}{publish in top scientific journals}
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item Our students have made significant contributions to  the \href{{http://www.mn.uio.no/english/about/collaboration/cse/}}{Computing in Science Education}  (UiO education prize in 2011) by developing exercises and participating in educational projects at the MN faculty

\item Our students have also developed educational \href{{http://www.mn.uio.no/fysikk/om/aktuelt/aktuelle-saker/2015/realfagsapper.html}}{tools and applications for understanding complicated physical problems}

\item A group of PhD students is now developing \href{{https://github.com/CINPLA/ibvcse}}{new textbooks for Computational Life Science}

\item 2005-2015: $> 60$ students have finalized their master's theses and 60\% have continued with PhD studies

\item Many students don't want to leave the group after finishing their studies

\subsection*{Building a local supercomputing cluster from titan.uio.no}
% !bslidecell 00 0.2

% --- begin paragraph admon ---
\paragraph{Our supercomuting cluster.}
When UiO's previous supercomputing cluster (titan.uio.no) was replaced by \textbf{abel.uio.no}, we got 200 nodes for free from USIT and built our own supercomputer. The value in 2006 of all the equipment was close to eight MNOK.
\begin{itemize}
\item It helps students run and develop programs for large-scale problems locally

\item A successful program can then run on larger national and international supercomputers

\item Students run and maintain the local supercomputer

\item Used in regular courses as well

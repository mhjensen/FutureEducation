===== Present and future education =====
!bblock

* _Research-based education_, from undergraduate studies to a PhD: "The Computational Physics group at the University of Oslo":"http://www.mn.uio.no/fysikk/english/research/groups/computational/index.html" as example
* Future challenges and directions
!eblock
!bblock Takeaway message
Excellent research depends on excellent education --- and vice versa!
#A successful research program cannot be disconnected from education and vice versa
!eblock

!split
===== The role of computations, from education to society =====
!bblock
_Computations are central to our 
basic understanding of nature and to technological advances_.
UiO's strength in computational science (education and research)
has the potential to make UiO a top European university.
!eblock

!bblock Examples
* _Nanotech and Materials_: quantum physical systems in nanotechnology; characteristics of new materials; semi-conductor devices and quantum computers
* _The smallest particles in nature_: subatomic physics at its smallest length scale
* _And the largest_: simulating galaxies and the evolution of the universe
* _Life science_: cancer treatment and how the brain works
* _Geosciences_: predicting climate changes and this week's weather, simulating natural disasters
* _Finance_: assessing risk in the insurance and financial industry
* and many many more

===== Modeling and computations as a way to enhance algorithminc thinking =====

!bblock
_Algorithm_ :
A set of instructions to solve a problem.
!eblock

!bblock 
_Algorithmic thinking applies to all disciplines. It_
* Enhances instruction-based teaching
* Introduces research-based teaching  from day one
* Triggers further insights in scientific problems
* Emphasizes validation and verification of scientific results, and integrates science ethics in a natural way
* Ensures good working practices from day one!

===== What does computing mean?  =====

!bblock

_Computing means solving scientific problems using computers. It covers numerical as well as symbolic computing. Computing is also about developing an understanding of the scientific process by enhancing the algorithmic thinking when solving problems._
!eblock

!bblock Computing competence is about:

* derivation, verification, and implementation of algorithms
* understanding what can go wrong with algorithms
* overview of important, known algorithms
* understanding how algorithms are used to solve complicated problems
* reproducible science and ethics
* algorithmic thinking for gaining deeper insights about scientific problems

All these elements (and many more) aid students in maturing and gaining a better understanding of the scientific process *per se*.

!split
===== Computing and research-based education =====

!bblock
A computational approach allows us to introduce research concepts and engage students in research from *day one*.
!eblock


!bblock What should the education contain?

* Theory + experiment + simulation is the norm in research and industry
* Modeling of real, complex systems with no simple answers
* Insight and understanding of fundamental principles and laws
* Visualization, presentation, discussion, interpretation, and critical analysis of results
* Development of a sound ethical attitude to own and other's work
* Enhanced reasoning about the scientific method
* Individually tailored education in order to let students  realize their full potentials and discover their creative powers

This is what we do in the "Computational Physics group at UiO":"http://www.mn.uio.no/fysikk/english/research/groups/computational/index.html"!

!bblock
Physics students can _pose and solve problems_ that combine _physical insights_ with _mathematical tools_ and now also _computational skills_.
Essential for multi-disciplinary programs.
#This provides a unique combination of applied and theoretical knowledge and skills. These features are invaluable for the development of multi-disciplinary educational and research programs.

===== A social and scientific learning environment =====

!bblock
_Goal: Students should realize their full potentials and discover their creative powers_

 * Students come with different dreams, ambitions, aspirations and topics they wish to study, our approach is to tailor the education to all these aspects
 * Our motto: foster students who are better than their supervisors
 * Emphasis is on learning and getting new insights
 * Students and teachers help each other
 * Students with different backgrounds and needs can thrive socially and scientifically
 * Non-competitive and generous environment
#Not a competitive environment, but a drive and enthusiam for sharing and developing knowledge. This is an important element for the  success of for example multi-disciplinary projects 
!eblock



!split
===== We develop a social and scientific learning environment =====

!bblock
* We target bachelor, MSc and PhD students
* Project-oriented work where students develop and mature their own ideas, with an individually tailored approach to each student
* Office space with desktops to every student and large common room for recreational activities (meals, gaming, movies)
* Many students collaborate on similar  thesis topics and "publish in top scientific journals":"http://www.dn.no/talent/2014/06/12/Utdannelse/sommervikar-ble-toppforsker"

===== Features of the Computational Physics group =====
!bblock
* Our students have made significant contributions to  the "Computing in Science Education":"http://www.mn.uio.no/english/about/collaboration/cse/"  (UiO education prize in 2011) by developing exercises and participating in educational projects at the MN faculty
* Our students have also developed educational "tools and applications for understanding complicated physical problems":"http://www.mn.uio.no/fysikk/om/aktuelt/aktuelle-saker/2015/realfagsapper.html"
* A group of PhD students is now developing "new textbooks for Computational Life Science":"https://github.com/CINPLA/ibvcse"
* 2005-2015: $> 60$ students have finalized their master's theses and 60% have continued with PhD studies
* Many students don't want to leave the group after finishing their studies

===== Investing in equipment for research and education =====
!bslidecell 00 0.2
!bblock
Large screens for visualizing and presenting scientific results. And gaming and other social activities. 
* Here we see two students displaying results from large-scale simulations of molecules in materials
* With 3D visualization tools one can see structures which where not possible until recently

===== Building a local supercomputing cluster from titan.uio.no =====
!bslidecell 00 0.2
!bblock Our supercomuting cluster
When UiO's previous supercomputing cluster (titan.uio.no) was replaced by _abel.uio.no_, we got 200 nodes for free from USIT and built our own supercomputer. The value in 2006 of all the equipment was close to eight MNOK.
* It helps students run and develop programs for large-scale problems locally
* A successful program can then run on larger national and international supercomputers
* Students run and maintain the local supercomputer
* Used in regular courses as well

===== UiO has a unique opportunity to become a Leading European University =====

!bblock
UiO's strength in computational science (education and research)
has the potential to make UiO a top European university

* We must educate the competence needed
* We are in a unique position to do so --- across all fields!
!eblock

!bblock   How to achieve this
* Establish  a new center/department with focus on computational science and its applications to a wide range of fields (natural science, medicine, social sciences, humanities, applied research etc)
* Hire ten young professors (age $< 40$) dedicated to innovative *computational* research and education
* Establish another ten professorships with  shared positions between the  new department and the discipline-specific department
* Establish  best practices for computational and educational innovations, with a particular focus on  new learning material and real incentives
!eblock

_The process must start now_ in order not to lose momentum.



!split
===== Our takeaway messages =====
!bblock
* Computing plays and will play an even more important role in society --– and this must be reflected in research and education
* Our program builds in this and allows students to realize their potential and unleash their creativity
* Social and scientific activities in harmony
* UiO is in a unique position to develop a leading research and educational activity --- if we act now
